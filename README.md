# pymongo-job-queue

This package (`pymjq`) is a simple MongoDB based job queue for Python. By using capped collections and tailable cursors, you can queue up data to be consumed by a service worker in order to process your long running tasks asynchronously.

~~This is currently used to send notifications on the Meta sites (a.k.a. Vinylhub, Bibliogs, Filmogs, Gearogs, Comicogs and the Reference Wiki).~~ This is a fork of the original package adapted to work with pymongo 4.2+ and to enable custom collection names.

### Install

```
$ pip install git+https://github.com/xverges/pymongo-job-queue.git
```

### Examples

```
>>> from pymongo import MongoClient
>>> from pymjq import JobQueue
>>> client = MongoClient("localhost", 27017)
>>> db = client.job_queue
>>> jobqueue = JobQueue(db)
Creating jobqueue collection.
>>> jobqueue.valid():
True
>>> jobqueue.pub({"message": "hello world!"}) # add a job to queue
True
>>> for j in jobqueue:
...     print (j)
...     print (j["data"]["message"])
...
---
Working on job:
{u'status': u'waiting', u'_id': ObjectId('568d963d2c69a1e3ef34da84'),
  u'data': {u'message': u'hello world!'}...
hello world!
waiting!
waiting!
waiting!
...
^C Keyboard Interrupt
>>> jobqueue.pub({"message": "hello again!"}) # add another job to queue
True
>>>  j = jobqueue.next()
True
>>> print (j["data"]["message"])
hello again!
print (j)
{u'status': u'waiting', u'_id': ObjectId('568d963d2c69a1e3ef34da84'),
  u'data': {u'message': u'hello again!'}...
>>>

```

### How It Works

* [Capped collections](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/capped-collections/) ensure that documents are accessed in the natural order they are inserted into the collection.
* [Tailable cursors](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/create-tailable-cursor/) give us a cursor which will stay open and wait for new documents to process if the job queue is empty.
* The `JobQueue` class has an iterator that yields a document from our queue. The iterator will update a doc's status to 'working' and then 'done' once the worker has completed it's task.

#### Jobs

Job document, when added to the queue, has the following structure:

```python

{
    'ts': {
        'created': datetime,
        'started': datetime,
        'done': datetime
    },
    'status': 'string',
    'data': 'Your job data goes here! Define whatever structure you want. ''
}

```
In the `data` field, the `JobQueue.pub()` method will add whatever data you pass as a parameter. The `ts` attributes will be updated as the document is worked on.
